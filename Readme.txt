### 2.1.1 Branch Description
We are using feature base strategy, we have created a branch for each feature and then merged the branch to the main branch.

According to the lecture notes, once we merge the branch to the main branch, we need to delete the branch.

So, we cannot provide the decription of all branch in README.md.
