        <h2>The Yellow Dot: A Beacon of Knowledge and Connection</h2>
        <p>
          At the heart of our logo lies the **yellow dot**, symbolizing the
          boundless wisdom found in books. Its warm color represents the light
          of knowledge, the joy of discovery, and the connections that books
          foster among readers. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Just like books act as a medium to share stories
          and ideas, the yellow dot signifies the spark of wisdom that bridges
          cultures, experiences, and perspectives.
          It serves as a reminder of our mission: to make books accessible to
          everyone and to inspire curiosity, learning, and sharing through the
          timeless power of the written word.
